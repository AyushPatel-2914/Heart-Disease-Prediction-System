# Project Introduction

Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to assist in the early detection of heart disease using patient clinical data. Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and timely risk assessment can significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality. This project leverages data-driven techniques to provide a fast, accessible, and cost-effective method for predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

The system uses supervised machine learning classification models trained on medical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, ECG results, and other diagnostic indicators. By analyzing these features, the model predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease and provides a probability-based assessment to support clinical decision-making.

To make the solution practical and user-friendly, the trained model has been deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input patient data and receive real-time predictions through a simple interface.

# Objectives of the Project

Develop a supervised machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease).

Compare multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Identify the most influential medical features contributing to heart disease risk.

Deploy the final optimized model as a web application for real-world usability.
